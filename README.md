# üåê turbo-tor-crawl

## What is it?
This is crawler, which collects urls of hosts which are online. 
The project was started like `.onion` only hosts finder, that's why there is an _tor_ in the name, but now you can scan what ever.
That has gone through the stages of redesign and complete refactoring from the [old attempt to make a crawler](https://github.com/Apanazar/tor_crawl).

## How does it work?
Crawler gets an init site, from which it collects all URLs and then goes to them to collects URLS too, it's kinda recursion.

## How to use it?

To get help `./turbo-tor-crawler -h`, example below:
```
